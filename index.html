        <h2> Autonomous Drone</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>&emsp;The autonomous drone we have built can be operated through either a computer program or a remote
                controller. The drone can hold itself steady in the air even when the remote control is disabled, thus
                the name - <strong>autonomous</strong>. The program allows the user to set a predefined path of flight.
                The drone is capable of launching and landing, all on its own. It consists of a Pixhawk 4 flight
                controller as its prime component which includes an inbuilt gyroscope and an accelerometer. We have
                onboard GPS module and telemetry module for obtaining on-flight stats. With this, we hope to finally
                set foot into the exciting world of UAVs.</p>
            <p>&emsp;For now, the we have used open source codes avalable to build the drone. We have used the <a
                    href="http://qgroundcontrol.com/" target="_blank">QGroundControl</a> software. We plan to develop on
                it. The scope of application for such a drone can be expanded greatly, with the addition of proximity
                sensors, LiDAR or cameras of different sorts to sense its surroundings. The input from the sensors can
                be used to optimize the path of the drone using machine learning algorithms. We can also use slam
                algorithms and let it automatically determine an optimal path to its destination (avoiding the obstacles
                in its path).
