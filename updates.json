We used switchboard plates (Sunmica) (Rs 120) for the upper and lower plates which will hold the metal arms in place. We also had to buy screws, nuts and bolts of different sizes. We also went to Bhubaneshwar once (later) to buy small screws and special rubber spacers for soft-mounting the flight controller. ",

    "content": "Four equal-sized (~24cm) pieces were cut off from the long aluminium pipe for the arms. Holes were drilled into measured places of appropriate diameter. We took the help of the <strong>Central Worksop</strong> for drilling holes due to the unavailability of those appropriately sized drill bits in RTC. Later we bought those drill bits ourselves. We also cut 2 pieces of Sunmica, each of dimension 13*13cm. We drilled holes into it in appropriate positions. Then we attached the metal arms to the plates. We used two 1.5inch long M6 bolts for each arm (which makes up 8 nuts &bolts).",
